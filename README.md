## What is this?

"I'm at the GO station, which track should I be on?" - a uniquely suburban problem.

* None of the popular transit apps offer this information.
* GO/Metrolinx has a "departures" page but it's clunky and slow on a phone, especially when you're frantic because the train is coming in 2 minutes.
## Development status 

Aas of Nov 2021: Very rough proof of concept implemented on workers.dev
